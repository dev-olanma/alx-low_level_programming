C - Singly linked lists
A linked list is a type of data structure in computer science where each element, called a node, contains both a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and its reference is stored by the list itself. The last node in the list has a null reference, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists can be used to implement a variety of data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. Compared to arrays, linked lists have several advantages, including dynamic allocation of memory, efficient inserting and deleting of elements, and variable size. On the other hand, they have some drawbacks such as slower access time and difficulty in implementing algorithms that require random access to elements.
